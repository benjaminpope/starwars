Seismology with Adversarial Recurrent Stars

## The Idea

Can we use Generative Adversarial Networks to model red giant light curves, and then use the GANs to model their noise and look for planets?

## The Data

We've got a thousand of the best and brightest red giants, and we're going to train our GAN on one-day segments of long-cadence data.

## The Context

This is a project developed for [TESS Ninja 2](https://tess.ninja/two/) held at the University of Chicago, March 25-29 2019.
